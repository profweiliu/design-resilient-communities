Jan 26
: **Emerging Threats to Communities** <br>
*In this class, students will be introduced the concept of multimodal corridors and to the final project study site. Students will conduct a virtual environmental audit to evaluate existing corridor conditions, including mobility, land use, safety, and surrounding context. Based on this audit, students will develop a concise context summary that identifies key opportunities, constraints, and questions to inform subsequent design work.* <br>
