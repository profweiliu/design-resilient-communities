Welcome to EnD 4970 Design Resilient Communities in Spring 2026. I am looking forward to meeting you in person on Wednesday January 21, 2026.

The [course website](https://profweiliu.com/design-resilient-communities/) will serve as the primary hub for all course information, including the syllabus, schedule, readings, assignments, and announcements. Please make it a habit to check the course website regularly, as it will be the most up-to-date source of information throughout the semester. 

We will also use Canvas for assignment submissions, feedback, and grading. All information posted on the course website will be synced to Canvas for your reference; however, the course website should be considered the primary source for course materials and updates.

Before our first class meeting, please take a few minutes to:
- Review the course website
- Familiarize yourself with the syllabus and course structure

Best,

WL
