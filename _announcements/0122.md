Due to anticipated inclement weather and the university's campus closure notice, we will NOT meet for class tomorrow, Friday, January 23. 

Please use this time to stay safe and to review the reading materials and the [Assignment Instruction]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/#assignment-1-initial-reflection-on-resilient-communities) for the coming week. 
We will resume our regular class schedule next week.

Thank you for your flexibility.

Best,

WL
