{:.no_toc}

## Introduction

This final project engages students in the conceptual design of Durant Market Square, a 1.03-acre downtown site ([100 Evergreen St, Durant, OK 74701](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Market+Square/@33.9916459,-96.3765868,165m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x864b5f0058a9d7b7:0x901fa5f1c504ad43!8m2!3d33.9918538!4d-96.3761855!16s%2Fg%2F11xzv7s2f_?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDEyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)) that currently functions as a surface parking lot. The project envisions its transformation into the beating heart of the community, a year-round public gathering place that elevates arts, commerce, and social connection. The City of Durant imagines a beautifully landscaped public plaza where families interact with diverse amenities, neighbors connect through local markets and events, and touring artists perform on a permanent, professionally equipped stage.

The objective of this project is to translate the concept of resilient communities into clear, actionable design strategies. Students are expected to develop design recommendations that not only enhance the physical quality of Market Square through spatial organization, programming, beautification, accessibility, and environmental strategies, but also strengthen the community’s capacity to advance its goals. The Market Square is treated as critical community infrastructure that supports social, economic, environmental, and institutional resilience. 

## Community Goals
Your proposals should explicitly respond to the following community goals:
- Activate Every Season
- Foster Inclusivity & Belonging
- Champion Local Entrepreneurship
- Model Environmental Sustainability
- Cultivate Collaboration
- Elevate Durant's Profile

## Deliverable

By the end of the project, student teams will produce a set of integrated design recommendations that include:
- **An Executive Summary** (200 words max.)
- **A Resilience Statement** (50 words max.) clearly articulating how the proposal supports community resilience
- **A Existing Condition Illustration**, including visual and narrative
- **A Rendered Proposed Site Plan**, including adjacent streets and alleys (8.5 in. x 8.5 in. full-page layout)
- **A Programming Diagram****, illustrating permanent, seasonal, and flexible uses (8.5 in. x 8.5 in. full-page layout)
- **A Matrix of Resilient Design and Planning Strategies**, explicitly mapping recommendations to the community goals (matrix template will be provided). 

## Evaluation Rubric Statement

While grounded in a real-world community context, proposals are evaluated based on how clearly, convincingly, and visually the narrative, site plan, programming, and resilient strategies advance the stated community goals.

## Project Groups

Students will be organized into two groups, with seven students in each group. Prior to group formation, students will complete a brief survey assessing their skill sets and prior experience. Based on the survey results, the instructor will form the two groups to ensure a balanced and representative mix of backgrounds, skills, and perspectives within each team.

## Community Snapshot

Durant’s story begins on the rolling prairie of southeast Oklahoma, where Choctaw leader Dixon Durant founded a small settlement alongside the newly laid Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad in the 1870s. From those modest origins, Durant grew into the county seat of Bryan County at statehood in 1907 and has since remained the cultural and economic heart of the Texoma region.

What makes Durant uniquely magnetic is the intersection of Native heritage, academic energy, and hometown pride. As headquarters of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, the city honors centuries of Indigenous legacy through community leadership and cultural preservation. Nearby, the world-class Choctaw Cultural Center and the Choctaw Casino & Resort further elevate Durant as both a cultural and economic destination. At the same time, Southeastern Oklahoma State University (SOSU) infuses the city with youthful curiosity, creative spirit, and intellectual energy. Each summer, the university hosts the Oklahoma Shakespearean Festival, one of the longest-running theatrical traditions in the region.

Every spring, the city comes alive with the Magnolia Festival, a celebration of Durant’s identity as the *“Magnolia Capital of the World.”* The event draws thousands to town for live music, artisan crafts, cultural showcases, and a vibrant community atmosphere that reflects the best of who we are.

At the center of it all is historic downtown Durant—a place where past and present meet. Our downtown is more than brick and mortar; it’s a living stage where Main Street initiatives breathe new life into century-old storefronts and where neighbors gather for everything from pop-up art shows to holiday parades and cookouts. Anchored by Market Square, this area is the heart of community gathering, commerce, and celebration. Through the leadership of Durant Main Street, and with support from civic programs like Leadership Durant, this space is evolving to meet the needs of a growing and diverse population.

Just beyond downtown, Durant’s beauty expands into the surrounding landscape. Lake Texoma, one of the largest reservoirs in the nation, offers premier fishing, boating, and outdoor recreation. Closer to town, Durant Lake and an extensive system of local parks provide family-friendly amenities and natural escapes. Historic treasures like Fort Washita offer powerful reminders of the region’s complex frontier and Native history. Kiamichi Technology Centers prepare students for careers that fuel the local economy and ensure Durant’s progress remains rooted in opportunity.

In Durant, history and progress move hand in hand—honoring our past while building toward a future defined by community connection, cultural pride, and inclusive public spaces. The revitalization of Market Square is more than a physical improvement; it’s a continuation of our story—a bold reinvestment in the heart of Durant where everyone belongs.
