# Final Project
{:.no_toc}

## Introduction

This final project engages students in the conceptual design of Durant Market Square, a 1.03-acre downtown site (100 Evergreen St, Durant, OK 74701) that currently functions as a surface parking lot. The project envisions its transformation into the beating heart of the community, a year-round public gathering place that elevates arts, commerce, and social connection. The City of Durant imagines a beautifully landscaped public plaza where families interact with diverse amenities, neighbors connect through local markets and events, and touring artists perform on a permanent, professionally equipped stage.

The objective of this project is to translate the concept of resilient communities into clear, actionable design strategies. Students are expected to develop design recommendations that not only enhance the physical quality of Market Square through spatial organization, programming, beautification, accessibility, and environmental strategies, but also strengthen the community’s capacity to advance its long-term goals and priorities. The Market Square is treated as critical community infrastructure that supports social, economic, environmental, and institutional resilience. 

## Community Goals
Your proposals should explicitly respond to the following community goals:
- Activate Every Season
- Foster Inclusivity & Belonging
- Champion Local Entrepreneurship
- Model Environmental Sustainability
- Cultivate Collaboration
- Elevate Durant's Profile

## Deliverable

By the end of the project, student teams will produce a set of integrated design recommendations that include:
- An Executive Summary (200 words max.)
- A Resilience Statement (50 words max.) clearly articulating how the proposal supports community resilience
- A Rendered Proposed Site Plan, including adjacent streets and alleys (8.5 in. x 8.5 in. layout)
- A Programming Diagram, illustrating permanent, seasonal, and flexible uses (8.5 in. x 8.5 in. layout)
- A Matrix of Resilient Design and Planning Strategies, explicitly mapping recommendations to the community goals. 

While grounded in a real-world community context, proposals are evaluated based on how clearly, convincingly, and visually the narrative, site plan, programming, and resilient strategies advance the stated community goals.
