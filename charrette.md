## Schedule & Program

### Friday, March 6, 2026: The Resilience Diagnosis

**Goal:** Students become experts in dimensions of the City Resilient Framework (CRF) and establish resilient design parameters.

      The charrette begins with an introduction to the City of Durant study area, including site boundaries, key context, and the overall charrette structure. Students are introduced to the City Resilience Framework (CRF) and its four dimensions: <br>1. Health & Wellbeing <br>2. Economy & Society <br>3. Infrastructure & Environment <br>4. Leadership & Planning <br>

      Students form research groups of three and are each assigned 2 specific dimensions or goals within the CRF. Acting as experts, groups diagnose the City of Durant through a multi-scalar lens, identifying risks, opportunities, and performance gaps at three scales: <br> 1. City/Community <br> 2. Neighborhood/District <br> 3. Block/Street/Building

      Each research group translates its findings into a one-page Resilience Cheat Sheet. This document serves as the rulebook for Day 2 and defines three clear and measurable parameters that the Resilient Durant Plan must satisfy within that dimension or goal. For example, the plan must include 30% green space coverage, or the plan must ensure safe routes to schools.

      Groups pin up their analyses and cheat sheets for collective review. As a class, students evaluate and negotiate the proposed criteria to ensure they are realistic, measurable, and not in conflict with one another. The outcome is a shared and finalized set of resilience performance criteria for use on Day 2.

### Saturday, March 7, 2026: The Resilient Masterplan

**Goal:** Students form new teams to synthesize the agreed-upon criteria into a cohesive spatial masterplan for the City of Durant.

  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>
      Design teams operate as planning firms tasked with producing a spatial masterplan for the Durant site. The plan must integrate all Day-1 “must-have” criteria into a single, coherent proposal, requiring teams to negotiate trade-offs across systems, scales, and resilience dimensions.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>
      Stop designing, exchange plans with another team and use City Resilient Framework as a checklest. Each team audits the other’s proposal to identify missing or weak components. (e.g., "Does this plan meet Goal 5 sustainable waste & resource management?" or "Does it meet Goal 9 security & public safety?")

      <strong>Final Presentation & Matrix Formation</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>
      Each team delivers a 15-minute presentation. Proposals must be framed not only as design interventions, but as resilient systems, explicitly explaining how spatial decisions address all four dimensions of the City Resilience Framework. <br> The charrette concludes with a collective synthesis, producing a shared Resilience Matrix for Durant that highlights common strategies, key insights, and opportunities for future design and policy action.
