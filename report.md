{:.no_toc}

## Purpose of the Independent Research
This indenpendent research introduces students to the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) initiative, one of the most influential global framework for urban resilience. Through comparative analysis, students will gain exposure to how cities and communities across different global contexts define risks, set priorities, and propose resilience strategies.

By conducting their own comparative research and learning from peers' presentations, students will develop a broader understanding of urban resilience as a multi-dimensional concept that integrates environmental, social, economic, and institutional perspectives.
