# Comparative Review of 100 Resilient Cities Reports
{:.no_toc}

## Purpose of the Independent Research
This indenpendent research introduces students to the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) initiative, one of the most influential global framework for urban resilience. Through comparative analysis, students will gain exposure to how cities and communities across different global contexts define risks, set priorities, and propose resilience strategies.

By conducting their own comparative research and learning from peers' presentations, students will develop a broader understanding of urban resilience as a multi-dimensional concept that integrates environmental, social, economic, and institutional perspectives. 

## Presentation Requirement (15 minutes)

The presentation should focus on comparison, not description alone. Students are encouraged to use slides, diagrams, or tables. 

- City Context 
    - Basic information on each city (location, population, major environmental risks)
    - Why these risks matter for the city
- Resilience Priorities and Strategies
    - Key resilience goals identified in each city's report
    - Major strategies or focus areas (e.g., infrastructure, social systems, governance, environment)
- Comparative Insights
    - What similarities do you observe between the two cities
    - What differences stand out, and why they might exist
- Reflection
    - What tensions, limitations, or challenges can you identify
    - Select one resilience strategy from either of the two cities and address how this strategy could be translated into a concrete design intervention (e.g., public space, street, building, landscape, or infrastructure element)

## Essay Requirement 

### Prompt

The essay should expand on the presentation and address the following: 
- Resilience priorities and strategies for each city
- key similarities and differences in strategies across the two cities
- Observed synergies (where strategies address multiple goals)
- observed trade-offs or tensions (e.g., equity vs. infrastructure, short-term vs. long-term goals)
