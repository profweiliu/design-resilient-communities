# Comparative Review of 100 Resilient Cities Reports
{:.no_toc}

## Purpose of the Independent Research
This indenpendent research introduces students to the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) initiative, one of the most influential global framework for urban resilience. Through comparative analysis, students will gain exposure to how cities and communities across different global contexts define risks, set priorities, and propose resilience strategies.

By conducting their own comparative research and learning from peers' presentations, students will develop a broader understanding of urban resilience as a multi-dimensional concept that integrates environmental, social, economic, and institutional perspectives. 

## Presentation (15 minutes)

Students are encouraged to use slides, diagrams, tables or other visual materials as appropriate. There is no required presentation format. You are free to organize and communicate your analysis in a way best supports your argument, as long as the components below are clearly addressed. 

Your presentation should address all of the following areas:
- City Context 
    - Basic information on each city (location, population, major environmental risks)
    - Why these risks matter for the city
- Resilience Priorities and Strategies
    - Key resilience goals identified in each city's report
    - Major strategies or focus areas (e.g., infrastructure, social systems, governance, environment)
- Comparative Insights
    - What similarities do you observe between the two cities
    - What differences stand out, and why they might exist
- Reflection
    - What tensions, limitations, or challenges can you identify
    - Selection of one resilience strategy from either city and a discussion of how it could be translated into a concrete design intervention (e.g., public space, street, building, landscape, or infrastructure element)

### Submission Deadline

Presentation materials (slides or other visual materials) are due by **11:59 PM on the day of your presentation**.
